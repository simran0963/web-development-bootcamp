                                                                         WHAT IS CSS?



  CSS stands for "Cascading Stylesheets"
    1. not a programming language.
    2. Stylesheet/ Styling language.
    3. Used for website layout and design.
    4. By default CSS do not have any logic so it is used with HTML, XML, XHTML or can be extended with Sass/Less.
      -> Sass: Syntactically Awesome Sytlesheet and
      -> Less: Leaner CSS are CSS preprocessors

INLINE CSS: relate to a speific HTML tag to style a particular page element.
	    less flexible as each inline style that is created must be edited separately while a change in design.

  The first CSS element to learn is the style attribute which is kept under the body tag and is followed by : ="background-color: colour;" for 
  changing the bg colour of the website.It is used as:
    1. <body style="background-color: blue;"> when using the keyword values.
    2. <body style="background-color: #bbff00;"> for the hexadecimal values.
    3. <body style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 128);"> when using the RGB values.
    4. <body style="background-color: hsl(50, 33%, 25%);"> when using the HSL values.
    5. <body style="background-color: currentcolor;"> when using the special keyword values.
    6. <body style="background-color: inherit;"> when using theGlobal values.

INTERNAL CSS: holds CSS rules for page in the head section of the HTML file.
	      rules only apply to that particular page but you can arrange CSS classes and ID's to style multiple elements in the page code.

  Again style is used but as a tag and within the head tag after the closing title tag.
  so within the style tag an element body is specified using CSS code as which affects the style of the body element as:
    1. <style>
        body {
	      background-color= "#bbff00"
      }
    </style>
    2. similarly other elements like img could also be used as tags and modified by using attributes such as bg color, border, height, etc..

EXTERNAL CSS: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

  Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
  An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

  The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

  Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks:
    1. "mystyle.css"
      body {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }

      h1 {
        color: navy;
        margin-left: 20px;
      }
    Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit (such as margin-left: 20 px;). The correct way is: margin-left: 20px

NOTE*: if we specify css rules for the same property in different places, the inline css is prioritized over the internal and external css, 
       also internal css is given more priority iver the external css.
       it is usually suggested to implement all the styles inside the external css.
